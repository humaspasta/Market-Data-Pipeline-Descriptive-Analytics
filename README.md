# Market-Data-Pipeline-Descriptive-Analytics

Create a cached, quality‑checked data store for 6–10 symbols plus a notebook
that visualises price history, return distribution, correlations, and drawdowns.

#How to use it:

1) Clone this repository
2) In symbols.txt, type all tickers you wish to analyze. Ensure that they are comma seperated and the ticker is a valid ticker. 
3) Run all code within the notebook to get descriptive graphs, correlation heatmap, log returned histogram, and drawdown curve.
